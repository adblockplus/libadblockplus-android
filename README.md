Adblock Android SDK
================================

An Android library project, tests, settings fragments and demo application for AdblockWebView.



## Dependencies

The majority of project dependencies are declared as git [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules),
make sure your checkout contains submodules. For example `git clone --recurse-submodules` when
initially cloning or `git submodule update --recursive --init` to update an existing clone.
There is also single `com.jakewharton.timber` Maven dependency.

## Library

An Android library that provides the core functionality of Adblock Plus.
You can find it in the 'adblock-android' directory.

### Using as a Gradle dependency

Make sure you have `jcenter()` in the list of repositories and then add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.adblockplus:adblock-android:+'
}
```

In general case it's suggested to use the most recent version.

### Building

#### Requirements

* [The Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk)
* Android SDK Build tools 30.0.2
* [The Android NDK, 16b](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases#ndk-16b-downloads)

Edit 'buildToolsVersion' in 'build.gradle' files if necessary.

#### Building of libadblockplus

First, make sure all the [prerequisites](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/libadblockplus/blob/master/README.md#supported-target-platforms-and-prerequisites) are installed.
Second, one needs to build `V8` required for `libadblockplus`.
See `libadblockplus/README` or V8 documentation on how to build V8 or
fetch precompiled one. For the latter, run in 'libadblockplus' directory:

    make TARGET_OS=android ABP_TARGET_ARCH=arm Configuration=release get-prebuilt-v8
    make TARGET_OS=android ABP_TARGET_ARCH=arm64 Configuration=release get-prebuilt-v8
    make TARGET_OS=android ABP_TARGET_ARCH=ia32 Configuration=release get-prebuilt-v8
    make TARGET_OS=android ABP_TARGET_ARCH=x64 Configuration=release get-prebuilt-v8

Make sure to set `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT` environment variable to point to Android NDK installation, eg.:

    export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/Users/developer/ndk/android-ndk-r16b

After that we can build `libadblockplus`:

    make TARGET_OS=android ABP_TARGET_ARCH=arm Configuration=release
    make TARGET_OS=android ABP_TARGET_ARCH=arm64 Configuration=release
    make TARGET_OS=android ABP_TARGET_ARCH=ia32 Configuration=release
    make TARGET_OS=android ABP_TARGET_ARCH=x64 Configuration=release

#### Building from command-line

In the project root directory create the file _local.properties_ and set
_sdk.dir_ and _ndk.dir_ to where you installed it, e.g.:

    sdk.dir = /some/where/sdk
    ndk.dir = /some/where/ndk

In the project root directory run:

    ./gradlew assembleDebug

This will generate *.aar artifacts in the '.../build/outputs/aar/' directories:

* adblock-android-abi_all-... - AAR for all the ARCHs (x86, armv7a, arm64)
* adblock-android-abi_x86-... - AAR for x86 only
* adblock-android-abi_x86_64-... - AAR for x86_64 only
* adblock-android-abi_arm-... - AAR for armv7a only
* adblock-android-abi_arm64-... - AAR for arm64 only
* adblock-android-webview-... - AAR for AdblockWebView
* adblock-android-settings-... - AAR for Settings

**Android permissions note**

An app that uses the library have to add the following permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
 * `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>`
 * `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>`
 * `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>`

(added automatically if building with Gradle or should be added manually otherwise).

### Build directory configuration

By default Gradle uses `build` directory to build modules, however it can be undesired
for some use cases like CI or building as Chromium submodule.
Set `GRADLE_BUILD_DIR` environment variable to configure build directory:

    GRADLE_BUILD_DIR=/tmp ./gradlew clean assemble

Note

    [Configuration] Building project in /tmp

output while building

### Building with prebuilt shared V8

This can be desired to use product's V8 (let's say Chromium) instead of built-in V8.
Put prebuilt shared V8 library file(s) in ARCH directories and set `SHARED_V8_LIB_FILENAMES`
environment variable and `SHARED_V8_LIB_DIR` before building.
You can pass multiple filenames in `SHARED_V8_LIB_FILENAMES`, separated with space.
Libadblockplus is required to be linked with that library file(s).

For example:

    SHARED_V8_LIB_FILENAMES=libv8.cr.so SHARED_V8_LIB_DIR="/tmp/shared_v8" ./gradlew clean assembleAbi_arm

or

    SHARED_V8_LIB_FILENAMES="libv8.cr.so libv8_libbase.cr.so libv8_libplatform.cr.so" SHARED_V8_LIB_DIR="/tmp/shared_v8" ./gradlew clean assembleAbi_arm

for multiple library files.

Note

    [Configuration] Excluding shared v8 library libv8.cr.so from AAR
    ...
    [Configuration] Linking dynamically with shared v8 library /tmp/shared_v8/release/libv8.cr.so
    ...

output while building.

### Building with exposing of libadblockplus classes

Set `EXPOSE_LIBABP_OBJECTS` environment variable to expose libadblockplus classes in shared library.

For example:

    EXPOSE_LIBABP_OBJECTS=y ./gradlew clean assembleAbi_arm

### JNI adjustments

In order to load custom library name pass `LIBABP_SHARED_LIBRARY_NAME` environment variable (without `lib` and `.so`):

    LIBABP_SHARED_LIBRARY_NAME=adblockplus ./gradlew assembleRelease

In order to skip compilation of JNI classes pass `SKIP_JNI_COMPILATION` environment variable:

    SKIP_JNI_COMPILATION=true ./gradlew assembleRelease

### Building for single ARCH

By default adblock-android is built for ARM/ARM64 and x86/x86_64 and it can be filtered when
building end-user android application. However sometimes it can be desired to build
"adblock-android.aar" for single ARCH.

Pass `abi_arm`, `abi_arm64`, `abi_x86`, or `abi_x86_64` to build it for single arch or `abi_all` for all ARCHs:

    `./gradlew clean assembleAbi_arm`

Note

    [Configuration] Using adblock-android ABI flavor: abi_arm

output while building.

## SDK tests

### Pure java tests

You can find pure Java tests in 'src/test' directories of the modules (if provided).
In the project directory run:

    ./gradlew test

You can select test class/method and click 'Run ..Test'.
No Android emulator/device running required.

### Android tests

You can find Android tests in 'src/androidTest' directories of the modules (if provided).
In the project directory run:

    ./gradlew connectedAbi_x86DebugAndroidTest

to test with x86 device/emulator or run:

    ./gradlew connectedAbi_armDebugAndroidTest

to test with ARM device/emulator.
You can select test class/method and click 'Run ..Test'.

## Settings

An Android library that provides a configuration interface for Adblock Plus.
You can find it in the 'adblock-android-settings' directory:
* GeneralSettingsFragment - main fragment
* WhitelistedDomainsSettingsFragment - whitelisted domains fragment

### Using as a Gradle dependency

Make sure you have `jcenter()` in the list of repositories and then add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.adblockplus:adblock-android-settings:+'
}
```

In general case it's suggested to use the most recent version.

### Usage

Create `AdblockEngineProvider` instance and `AdblockSettingsStorage` instance.
You can use `SharedPrefsStorage` implementation to store settings in `SharedPreferences`.
Or you can use AdblockHelper:

    AdblockHelper
      .get()
      .init(this, getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath(), true, AdblockHelper.PREFERENCE_NAME);

      // optional - provide preloaded subscription files in app resources
      .preloadSubscriptions(AdblockHelper.PRELOAD_PREFERENCE_NAME, map);

Make sure you initialize it once during app launch, call `isInit()` to check it:

    if (!AdblockHelper.get().isInit())
    {
      // requires initialization
      ...
    }

Sometimes it's desired to initialize or deinitialize FilterEngine instance
when created:

    AdblockHelper
      .get()
      .init(...)
      .addEngineCreatedListener(engineCreatedListener)

or disposed:

    AdblockHelper
      .get()
      .init(...)
      .addEngineDisposedListener(engineDisposedListener)

Make sure you deinitialize it when values used during initialization are no longer valid:

    AdblockHelper.get().deinit();

Note: one have to initialize it again to be used.

Implement the following interfaces in your settings activity:

* `BaseSettingsFragment.Provider`
* `GeneralSettingsFragment.Listener`
* `WhitelistedDomainsSettingsFragment.Listener`

and return created instance or AdblockHelper instances:

    AdblockHelper.get().getProvider().getEngine();  // engine
    AdblockHelper.get().getStorage(); // storage

Retain Adblock instance in activity `onCreate` in synchronous mode (it may take few seconds):

    AdblockHelper.get().getProvider().retain(false);

or in asynchronous mode (without current thread lock):

    AdblockHelper.get().getProvider().retain(true);

Invoke `waitForReady` every time you need AdblockEngine instance if retained in asynchronous mode:

    AdblockHelper.get().getProvider().waitForReady();

Release Adblock instance in activity `onDestroy`:

    AdblockHelper.get().getProvider().release();

Insert `GeneralSettingsFragment` fragment instance in runtime to start showing settings UI.

#### Memory management
Adblock Engine sometimes might be extensive to memory consumption. In order to guard your process
from being killed by the system, call `AdblockEngine#onLowMemory()` method in
[ComponentCallbacks2#onTrimMemory(int)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ComponentCallbacks2#onTrimMemory(int)).

```java
  @Override
  public void onTrimMemory(int level)
  {
    // ...
    // if a system demands more memory, call the GC of the adblock engine to release some
    // this can free up to ~60-70% of memory occupied by the engine
    if (level == TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL && AdblockHelper.get().isInit())
    {
      AdblockHelper.get().getProvider().getEngine().onLowMemory();
    }
    // ...
  }
```

If you are using `androidx.fragment.app.Fragment` or `androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity`,
be sure to implement [[ComponentCallbacks2](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ComponentCallbacks2)]
and register it by calling `Context#registerComponentCallbacks(ComponentCallbacks2)`
and then unregister when not needed with `Context#unregisterComponentCallbacks(ComponentCallbacks2)`

If you are using old APIs, it's also possible to use any of `onLowMemory()` system callbacks:
either `Activity#onLowMemory()` or `Fragment#onLowMemory()`.

Please mind that if you are using `AdblockHelper` (which is in most cases), Adblock Filter Engine
exists only in one instance. Having one instance means that you only have to implement one call to
`AdblockHelper.get().getProvider().getEngine().onLowMemory();`. Thus it's recommended to do the call in `Activity`
or somewhere else where you are sure you are not creating multiple instances (e.g. fragments).

#### Background operations

By default filter engine will do some background operations like subscriptions synchronizations in background shortly
after initialized. If you want to have ad blocking as optional feature, you should consider use `setDisabledByDefault`

```
    AdblockHelper
      .get()
      .init(...)
      .setDisabledByDefault()
```

In this case no background operations will be done until you call `AdblockEngine.setEnabled(true)`. Please note that
`setDisabledByDefault()` only configures the default state. If user preference on enabled state is stored in settings it will have
priority.

Other thing to take into account is synchronization time. If you have configured `setDisabledByDefault` and then enable
engine, first synchronization will be done only after some time. You can combine configuration with
`preloadSubscriptions` to load data from local file first time rather then from web.

#### Preloaded subscriptions

As mentioned previously, there is an option to set preloaded subscriptions. This means that at the application's first boot time, and every time the user clears the app's data, it will load the subscription lists that are bundled with the app. It will also set async calls to update these lists at once so that they are updated as soon as possible. Keep in mind that the ad-block engine will still periodically check for updates on the subscriptions at an hourly interval.

The benefit of using this feature is that it provides a better UX since the app does not have to wait for the subscription lists to be downloaded first, allowing the user to have an ad-blocking experience right away.

On the other hand, this is an opt-in feature that you have to set up. It also increases the footprint of the app by bundling the subscription lists with it, and you have to update the lists when building the apk. This is because subscription lists become outdated very fast. Ideally, you can set a gradle task for that, which is what we did.

By running `./gradlew downloadSubscriptionLists`, you update the preloaded EasyList and exception list to the latest ones.

To set it up in the code, you can either explicitly map all the possible locale specific subscriptions URLs to local files. Or you can set one general subscription file for all non AA and another for the AA subscription.

Usage example in a simplified way where all blocking subscriptions (like "easylist.txt" or "easylistgermany+easylist.txt") are mapped to the same file R.raw.easylist:
``` java
adblockHelper
    .get()
    .init(this, basePath, true, AdblockHelper.PREFERENCE_NAME)
    .preloadSubscriptions(R.raw.easylist, R.raw.exceptionrules)
    .addEngineCreatedListener(engineCreatedListener)
    .addEngineDisposedListener(engineDisposedListener)
```
To explicitly set which subscriptions to be preloaded use `preloadSubscriptions()` with a map argument:
``` java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
map.put(AndroidHttpClientResourceWrapper.EASYLIST, R.raw.easylist);
map.put(AndroidHttpClientResourceWrapper.ACCEPTABLE_ADS, R.raw.exceptionrules);
```
Note that in this example we use the general EasyList subscription. So for example, if you are using subscription lists for another locale, you need to change the URL and replace the file with the correct one. The effect is not the same without these preloaded subscriptions.

Then, when using the `AdblockHelper` for example, you can set it like:
``` java
adblockHelper
    .get()
    .init(this, basePath, true, AdblockHelper.PREFERENCE_NAME)
    .preloadSubscriptions(AdblockHelper.PRELOAD_PREFERENCE_NAME, map)
    .addEngineCreatedListener(engineCreatedListener)
    .addEngineDisposedListener(engineDisposedListener)
```

### Theme

Make sure to set application theme with `PreferenceThemeOverlay.v14.Material` parent theme
(see `AndroidManifest.xml` and `styles.xml` in `adblock-android-webviewapp` as an example).

### Building

In the project root directory run:

    ./gradlew assemble

This will generate *.aar in the 'adblock-android-settings/build/outputs/aar' directory.

## WebView

An Android library that provides a WebView component with Adblock Plus integrated.
You can find it in the 'adblock-android-webview' directory.

`AdblockWebView` class provides built-in ad blocking
(both resource loading filtering and element hiding) and inherits from Android
['WebView'](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html).

### Using as a Gradle dependency

Make sure you have `jcenter()` in the list of repositories and then add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.adblockplus:adblock-android-webview:4.1'
}
```

In general case it's suggested to use the most recent version.

### Usage

In layout XML:

    <org.adblockplus.libadblockplus.android.webview.AdblockWebView
        android:id="@+id/main_webview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>

In java source code:

    AdblockWebView webView = findViewById(R.id.main_webview);

Use `AdblockEngine.setEnabled(boolean enabled)` to enable/disable ad blocking for AdblockEngine.
Make sure you update the settings model if you want the new value to be applied after application restart, eg:
```
AdblockSettingsStorage storage = AdblockHelper.get().getStorage();
AdblockSettings settings = storage.load();
if (settings == null) // not yet saved
{
  settings = AdblockSettingsStorage.getDefaultSettings(...); // default
}
...
settings.setAdblockEnabled(newValue);
storage.save(settings);
```

Android SDK logging system is based on Timber library.

If you are configuring your project using Maven dependencies to consume our Android SDK
then Timber dependency is automatically installed.
If you are just copying AAR files to your project workspace then you need to add this line to your dependencies:

`implementation 'com.jakewharton.timber:timber:4.7.1'`.

To enable desired log output level configure Timber logger in your application code.

For example this code enables all debug logs in DEBUG mode:
```
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    Timber.plant(new Timber.DebugTree());
}
```
Please refer to https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber for more information about Timber.

Use `setAllowDrawDelay(int allowDrawDelay)` to set custom delay to start rendering a web page after 'DOMContentLoaded' event is fired.

Use `setProvider(@NotNull AdblockEngineProvider provider)` to use external adblock engine provider.
The simplest solution is to use `AdblockHelper` from `-settings` as external adblock engine provider:

    webView.setProvider(AdblockHelper.get().getProvider());

If adblock engine provider is not set, it's created by AdblockWebView instance automatically.

Use `setSiteKeysConfiguration(..)` to support sitekeys whitelisting.
This is optional but highly suggested. See `TabFragment.java` on usage example.

Please note that the AdblockWebView does intercept some of the HTTP(S) requests done by the subclassed WebView and does them internally by means of `java.net.HttpURLConnection`. 
For doing so AdblockWebView maintains the cookies in sync between the `java.net.CookieManager` and `android.webkit.CookieManager`. The sync is maintained by replacing the default `CookieHandler` by a `SharedCookieManager` which stores all the cookies in `android.webkit.CookieManager` storage.
If a client code sets a cookie handler by calling `java.net.CookieHandler.setDefault()`, such a cookie handler will be later overwritten by our custom `SharedCookieManager` which is set by AdblockWebView when loading any url.

Use `enableJsInIframes(true)` to enable element hiding and element hiding emulation for iframes in AdblockWebView.
This feature does not support yet element hiding for blocked requests.
This is optional feature which under the hood rewrites html content to inject before the `</body>` tag `<script nonce="..">..</script>` with our custom element hiding (emulation) JavaScript, and if necessary updates CSP HTTP response header adding our `nonce` string to execute the script.
This feature also requires `setSiteKeysConfiguration(..)` to be called beforehand, otherwise an IllegalStateException is thrown.
See `TabFragment.java` on usage example.

Use `setEventsListener()` to subscribe and unsubscribe to ad blocking and whitelisting events, eg.
"resource loading blocked" or "resource loading whitelisted" event that can be used for stats.
For the latter there is a convenience class `WebViewCounters` which can be bound to `EventsListener`
and notify your View about new values. See an example of usage in WebView Application.

Use `dispose(Runnable disposeFinished)` to release resources (**required**).
Note it can be invoked from background thread.

Enabling/disabling of ad blocking per AdblockWebView is not supported.

Ad blocking requires JavaScript to be enabled and every AdblockWebView instance enables JavaScript
during the initialization.

### Building

In the project root directory run:

    ./gradlew assemble

This will generate *.aar in the 'adblock-android-webview/build/outputs/aar' directory.

## WebView Application

An Android application that demonstrates how to use AdblockWebView.
You can find it in the 'adblock-android-webviewapp' directory.

### Building

Make sure _Library_ requirements are present.

In the project root directory run:

    ./gradlew assemble

This will generate *.apk in the 'adblock-android-webviewapp/build/outputs/apk/' directory.

## Proguard

### Required configuration changes

Configure Proguard/R8 to skip Adblock Android SDK files (root package `org.adblockplus.libadblockplus`)
from being modified for `Release` build of end-user application.
See `adblock-android/proguard-rules-adblock.txt` as an example. If building end-user application
with Gradle, no actions are required - Gradle will use provided consumer Proguard file automatically.
See https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library
"A library module may include its own ProGuard configuration file" section for further information.

### Reason

Adblock Android SDK uses JNI behind the scene so Java classes and methods are accessed by full
names from native code. If class names/members are modified by Proguard/R8 during `Release` build
they can't be accessed from native code resulting into Runtime exceptions like follows:

    java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: no non-static method "Lorg/adblockplus/libadblockplus/JsValue;.<init>(J)V"

## Contribute

You are more then welcome to contribute! Please use *Building* 
sections from corresponding submodules in order to set up build them and start developing.

### Git commits

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to maintain agreed conventions in the repo. It should
be [installed](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) (tldr; `pip install pre-commit` then `pre-commit install`)
before making any new commits to the repo.

### Code style
We use [Eyeo Coding Style Convention](https://adblockplus.org/coding-style) as a base. 
In general:

* Follow the [Mozilla Coding Style](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/code-quality/coding-style/coding_style_java.html) general practices and its naming and formatting rules.
* All files should have a license header, but no mode line comments.
* Newline at end of file, otherwise no trailing whitespace.
* Lines can be longer than the limit, if limiting line length would hurt readability in a particular case.
* Opening braces always go on their own line.
* No Hungarian notation, no special variable name prefixes or suffixes denoting type or scope. 
* All variable names start with a lower case letter.
* Don't comment code out, delete it.

#### Java
Overall it inherits basic code style rules above. More specific rules:
* Spaces over tabs 
* Indentation is in increment of two spaces.
* Dedicated new line on opening opening brackets and closing brackets.
```java
// good 
void doSomething()
{
  if (that())
  {
  }
}
// bad 
void doSomething(){
  if (that()) {
  }
}
```
* Inline comments leave space after marker 
* Remove trailing white spaces 
* Don’t exceed 120 characters per line
* **else** should be followed with new line
* Add new line at the end of file 
* Variables, parameters and class members should be final where it is possible (they are not modified)

We use [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) to verify syntax for Java. You can find the 
config in `config\checkstyle\checkstyle.xml`

You can verify the syntax in sevaral ways:
1. [Gradle Checkstyle plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html). 
Just run `./gradlew checkstyle` and it will perform codestyle check over all the submodules, 
including tests. Also
    * you can run the check over a submodule (eg `./gradlew :adblock-android:checkstyle`)
    * you can run the check on tests on main source files only: 
    `./gradlew checkstyleMain` or `./gradlew checkstyleAndroidTest` or `./gradlew checkstyleAndroidTest`
2. [Android Checkstyle plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea). Install
the plugin and import the `config\checkstyle\checkstyle.xml`. Then it will be automatically checking
the codestyle for you.
3. Pre-commit hook. For installation and usage, please check the [Git commits section](#Git-commits).
We use [github.com/gherynos/pre-commit-java](https://github.com/gherynos/pre-commit-java) hook for 
checking codestyle. It will run on every commit if *pre-commit hooks* are installed.
